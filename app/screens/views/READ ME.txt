!!!!!!!!!! To test these screens use the following code in App.js
ALSO this is how you can use the screens and what data its accepting.
Agar koi masla hua tou bata dena, I'll fix it with the data it's actually
getting if its different.


import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import ViewYourListingsDetails from './app/screens/views/ViewYourListingsBuy';

let app_images = [
    require('../renfri/app/assets/upload_images_buy.png'),
    require('../renfri/app/assets/upload_images_buy.png'),
    require('../renfri/app/assets/upload_images_buy.png'),
    require('../renfri/app/assets/upload_images_buy.png'),
    require('../renfri/app/assets/upload_images_buy.png'),
]

var data = {
    category: "buy",
    title: "This is my listing",
    desc: "Description description description description description description description description description description description description description description description.",
    price: 3000,
    duration: "1-2 hours",
    insurance: 2000,
    tags: "M7, iron",
    images: app_images,
    urgent: true,
    status: "open",
    date: "14/04/2022, 3:45PM",
    interested_users: [{id: 0, name: "Minahil Faisal", email: "23100063@lums.edu.pk", rating: 2},
                    {id: 1, name: "Fatima Sohail", email: "23100065@lums.edu.pk", rating: 3},
                    {id: 2, name: "Ajwa Shahid", email: "23100066@lums.edu.pk", rating: 4}],
};

export default function App() {
    return (
        <ViewYourListingsDetails data={data}/>
    );
}
